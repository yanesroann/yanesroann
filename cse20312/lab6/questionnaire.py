# Program: questionnaire.py 
# Author: Roann Yanes
# This program acts as evidence of executable code that I have checked into our repository.
# This program asks the user a series of questions to figure out the user's preferences to create a personalized Netflix watching schedule for the user. 
# It is basically a questionnaire. The program outputs the user's responses to the terminal in a nicely formatted way.
# To run the program, just enter './questionnaire.py' at the command line.

QUESTION5 = 'How many hours a day would you like to watch Netflix? '
