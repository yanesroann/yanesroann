I worked with Roann Yanes.
We made Tetris. We have a lot of code, especially in tetrisboard.cpp so it looks A LOT better if you open it in a full window. Also, our report is really long so a full window might help with that too. Also, once our game is over, a "GOOD JOB" screen pops up. (The "B" looks a little weird but I'm good with it.) That screen just stays up for 10 seconds then closes on its own. I just wanted to make sure it was clear how it worked.
