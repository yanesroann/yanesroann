From the user's perspective: The program begins by opening a window with a menu displayed. The menu tells the user what fractal will be displayed for the number they press. If the user presses a number from 1-8, the corresponding fractal will display. If they press 'm', the menu will reappear. If they press 'q', the program will quit. 

From the programmer's perspective: The program first lists the prototypes for all the functions. Then, it opens a graphics window then runs through a while loop while 'q' has not been pressed. In the while loop, the program uses gfx_event_waiting to wait for a command to be entered. This command is then the argument for a switch case. The commands are as follows: 1 = Sierpinski Triangle, 2 = Shrinking Squares, 3 = Spiral Squares, 4 = Circular Lace, 5 = Snowflake, 6 = Tree, 7 = Fern, 8 = Spiral of Spirals, m = menu, q = quit.  This is the end of main. Then there are the functions. Triangle() and Square() draw their shapes given three vertices or both a center point and length, respectively. Each fractal calls its own recursive function that contains a call to gfx_color(), a base case of some sort, drawing the line/shape/etc. of the fractal, and one or more recursive calls with modified parameters. Spirals(), the function for Spiral of Spirals, is slightly different in that, for the part of it that draws the shape, it actually calls a separate recursive function, spiral(), for drawing recursive spirals. Spiral() uses a variable mradius, or main radius. This represents the distance a point is from the center of its spiral. Spiral() uses mradius to make a spiral around each point in a spiral until the radius of the smaller spiral is 1/3 the radius that the center of this smaller spiral is from the center of the bigger spiral it is a part of. (Very confusing to explain with words). Anyway, spiral() calls itself twice: once to continue making a spiral centered at a certain point and once to center a spiral at each point in the original spiral.

Evaluated for correctness: We evaluated this program for correctness just by running through every option multiple times. We ran the program, pressed 1-8 to ensure the correct fractals displayed correctly and that the screen cleared between each one. We also pressed 'm' and 'q' at different times throughout to make sure the menu would correctly appear and the program would quit. We also pressed random buttons or clicked the mouse to ensure that nothing happened for these events. Everything ran as expected.
