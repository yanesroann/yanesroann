CSE 30264 -- Computer Networks
Programming Assignment 1 - Simple UDP Program
September 17, 2018

The files that are present in the program1 directory are:
udpclient.c -- this program contains the code to run the client
udpserver.c -- this program contains the code to run the server
pg1lib.h -- this is the library that contains the encryption methods
Makefile -- this is the Makefile that compiles the UDP Program code

In order to compile the code, run the `make` command.
(You can also run `make clean` to remove the object files.)

Here is a command line example to test the code with a file and an input string:
` Server 
  [ryanes@student02 ~] $ ./udpserver 41050
  
  Client
  [ryanes@student00 ~] $ ./udpclient student02.cse.nd.edu 41050 /afs/nd.edu/coursefa.18/cse/cse30264.01/files/program1/File1.txt
  [ryanes@student00 ~] $ ./udpclient student02.cse.nd.edu 41050 "This is a test"`
